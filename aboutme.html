<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Connor Major/h3>

  <p> Hey, my name is Connor, and there's little I find more exciting than coding! 
    <br /> This is my test webpage (yay, html!)   
<br /> This webpage is still in development, so message me (contact u  s on main page)
    <br /> I'm 13, and enjoy computers, and have done this to challenge my Html skills. <br />
    NOW GO AWAY PLS
                                                                                                    </p>
